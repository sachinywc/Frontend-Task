## Use stuff of JS Mini to-do project

- Let Const Var
- Equality, Truthy/Falsy, Coercion == vs ===, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN.
- Functions and arrow-function function decl vs expr; arrow functions; returning values
- Array and object `push/splice (mutate) vs map/filter (new array);`
- Dom Selection and event example `js querySelector, .textContent, .value, addEventListener('click',â€¦).`

**Reflect**
- Const getElementByID select elements
- function void if else create elements which is li and span
- click event listener of array
- dom for the local storage via inner html like methods of storage set get item


## Three error I got

- mouse event target forget to add css of class list

- wrong element id

- double appendChild mistakes like appending the same element multiple times.


# Process I do to make this project
1. **Analysis** - create to do list app where user can add, edit, and delete tasks. user also want to tasks to stay visible until completed
2. **Planning** - feature add planning (add tasks, delete tasks and marks completed)
3. **Design** Plan the layout:
   - **html** => input box + add button + list section
   - **css** => colors, spacing, hover effects
   - **javascript** => functions to add, remove and mark tasks done
4. **Implementation** - write the code
   - `index.html` => contains input fields and tasks list
   - `style.css` => makes the app visibility clean
   - `script.js` => html elements, id, 
5. **Deployment** - host the project in local server sending GitHub
6. **Maintenance** - fix bug (e.g. tasks not saving), add features (like localstorage to remember tasks after refresh)
